# AWVT-
(AWVT) AUTOMATED WEB-VULLNERABILITY TESTER  A automated website VULLNERABILITY tester tool developed by Aditya kumar sahu, the tools performs the follwing test



Vulnerability Checks
✔️ DNS/HTTP Load Balancers & Web Application Firewalls.
✔️ Checks for Joomla, WordPress and Drupal
✔️ SSL related Vulnerabilities (HEARTBLEED, FREAK, POODLE, CCS Injection, LOGJAM, OCSP Stapling).
✔️ Commonly Opened Ports.
✔️ DNS Zone Transfers using multiple tools (Fierce, DNSWalk, DNSRecon, DNSEnum).
✔️ Sub-Domains Brute Forcing (DNSMap, amass, nikto)
✔️ Open Directory/File Brute Forcing.
✔️ Shallow XSS, SQLi and BSQLi Banners.
✔️ Slow-Loris DoS Attack, LFI (Local File Inclusion), RFI (Remote File Inclusion) & RCE (Remote Code Execution).


with these at end its creates a report file for better QA testing and also calculates the VULLNERABILITY of percentages.

# FEATURES


one-step installation.

executes a multitude of security scanning tools, does other custom coded checks and prints the results spontaneously.

some of the tools include nmap, dnsrecon, wafw00f, uniscan, sslyze, fierce, lbd, theharvester, amass, nikto etc executes under one entity.

saves a lot of time, indeed a lot time!.

checks for same vulnerabilities with multiple tools to help you zero-in on false positives effectively.

extremely light-weight and not process intensive.

legends to help you understand which tests may take longer time, so you can Ctrl+C to skip if needed.

association with OWASP Top 10 & CWE 25 on the list of vulnerabilities discovered. (under development)

critical, high, medium, low and informational classification of vulnerabilities.

vulnerability definitions guides you what the vulnerability actually is and the threat it can pose.

remediation tells you how to plug/fix the found vulnerability.

executive summary gives you an overall context of the scan performed with critical, high, low and informational issues discovered.

artificial intelligence to deploy tools automatically depending upon the issues found. for eg; automates the launch of wpscan and plecost tools when a wordpress installation is found. (under development)


detailed comprehensive report in a portable document format (*TXT) with complete details of the scans and tools used.
